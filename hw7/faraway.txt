We added a few lines into the levels functions to print out the set of names that are more than 6 nodes away. 
This could also be checked by putting the two names into the path function. This was nice because it would
separate nodes that had a distance of 6 or more by telling exactly how far away they were. It wasn't
time consuming because it would just print out a few names because there aren't very many nodes at distances of
7 or more and continue.
