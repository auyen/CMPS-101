For the average, we took increments of n = 200 from n = 200 to n = 10000. The average sorted plot 
most resembled the all-unsorted plot. Selection sort was almost twice as fast as insertion sort in 
both the unsorted and the random sorted plots. Merge sort was the fastest in the unsorted and random 
sorted plots as well. The reason why both selection and insertion are much slower than merge is that
those two algorithms do more comparisons and swapping.

When we ran the same randomizer algorithm on a different computer, selection was slower than insertion sort.
We believe the real cause is the difference in CPUs.
